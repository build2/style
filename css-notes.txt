Some mobile device dimentions:

Nexus 5   360 598
Nexus 6   412 690
iPhone 5  320 568
iPhone 6  375 667
iPhone 6+ 414 736
Galaxy 5  360 640
Galaxy 6  360 640

iPad            768 1024
Galaxy 2,3 10"  800 1280
Galaxy 2 7"     600 1024

Based on this, we define the following size brackets:

320-359    small phone portrait
360-567    big phone portrate
568-1023   phone landscape, tablets portrate 
1024-      tablets landscape, monitor

Body min-width:

320px ~ 20em @ 16px font-size. This is factored in when doing font boosting.
Specifying 320px directly seems to mess it up.

Font boosting results for font-size:1.1em (~18px), min-width:18em on Nexus 5:

     - about 40 characters in portrait
     - about 70 characters in landscape
     - landscape font appears slightly smaller

18em on smaller phones (e.g., iPhone 4) appears to trigger scrolling. 17em
works well, however.
